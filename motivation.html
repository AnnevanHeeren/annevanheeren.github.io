                <h3>What is Motivation?</h3>
                <p>
                     As stated by the Cambridge Dictionary, the defenition of motivation is enthusiasm for doing something,
                     or the need or reason for doing something. <br>
                     According to Kendra Cherry from verywellmind.com, motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. 
                     It is what causes you to act, whether it is getting a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book 
                     to gain knowledge. <br>
                     Furthermore, Cherry states that there are two types of motivation: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation.<br>
                     Extrinsic motivations are those that arise from outside of the individual and often involve rewards 
                     such as trophies, money, social recognition, or praise.
                     Intrinsic motivations are those that arise from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword 
                     puzzle purely for the personal gratification of solving a problem.<br>
                     A different source named Wiley Online Library also concludes that intrinsic motivation is the motivation to do something for its own sake, 
                     for the sheer enjoyment of a task. Extrinsic motivation is the motivation to do something in order to attain 
                     some external goal or meet some externally imposed constraint. Feelings of self‐determination, control, 
                     and satisfaction have long been linked to an intrinsically motivated state. 
                     Environmental constraints such as the imposition of time limits, an expected reward, 
                     or an impending evaluation can undermine feelings of self‐determination engendering an extrinsic orientation.

                <h3>What is Motivation?</h3>
                <p>
                     In a TED Talk about the facts science knows about motivation that managers don't, Dan Pink describes that 
                     traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think. On the contrary even, multiple studies show that when people 
                     are offered rewards in the form of money for performing tasks that require quite a lot of thinking, they perform less fast than people who were not offered any rewards.<br>
                     This is interesting, because a lot of companies seem to focus on this extrinsic way of motivating, what science has proved to be working contradictive.
                     This same study has been done but with a task that is much more simpler. The outcome of this experiment was, that the people who <i>were</i> offered rewards, 
                     performed faster than the ones who weren't.<br>
                     This shows that tasks that require creative or easy thinking, are generally performed better when offered a reward. It seems to be that this is not the case for tasks that require motoric thinking.
                </p>
                <h3>Performance motivation</h3>
                <p> According to a test which determines wheter I am intrinsically or extrinsically motivated I am mostly extrinsically motivated:
                    <i><b>'You are primarily extrinsically motivated. You prefer to let outside factors dictate your actions. </b>
                    <b>You tend to focus more on the finish line instead of the race. It usually takes an external incentive like money or grades to get you going. </b>
                    This can include negative motivation such as losing money or threats. This kind of attitude can really undermine your creative side. 
                    You might want to rethink your motives a little, you may find that some of your best work comes from being self-motivated.'</i><br></br>
                    I partially agree with this, because when I have tasks to do and I am not offered any rewards, I am not likely to be very motivated to do it.
                    On the other hand, even when offered a reward I like, but specifically told to do it how and when, my motivation won't be anywhere to be found either.
                    I am usually only motivated when it is a task that I can perform in any way I like and whenever I want, whether I am offered a reward or not.
                </p>
                <h3>Career values</h3>
                <p>
                    Structure is important to me, I have trouble doing a task when it has not been made clear what to do. This applies to main tasks, creativity is also important to me. 
                    This is something that makes a task more fun for me, which results in motivation.<br>
                    For example this website. School gave us the task to make a website with some guidelines for what should be in it. The design and content were totally up to me.
                    This is a good example for a task I do have motivation for, it contains structure, but it also creates room for creativity.<br></br>
                    One of the values that is not of importance to me, is influence. If I like doing a task but it doesn't influence people in a certain way, I don't mind it.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    I have come to the conclusion that my motivation is a mix of both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. 
                </p>
